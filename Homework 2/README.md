# Assignment 2
## Wireless Review 

- This assignment covers key concepts from the assigned reading of "Wireless Communication Networks and Systems" (Beard 2016). The homework focuses on wireless communication fundamentals, including signal processing, error control, and network protocols, and is designed to deepen your understanding of the cyber security implications of wireless networks.

### Instructions
- Answer the following questions based on the chapters from the textbook. Use LaTeX for your documentation.

### Chapter 1
1. Select three problems with wireless from page 7. Explain each in detail and how it is addressed:
   
    - **MIMO (Multiple-input Multiple-output)**: Method to increase the capacity of a radio link using multiple antennas. The challenge is managing interference and signal fading.
    
    - **Error Control Coding**: Technique used to detect and correct errors during data transmission, using methods like Golay Code.
    
    - **Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)**: Modulation technique that reduces signal interference by spreading the signal across a wide frequency band.

### Chapter 2

1. **Define bandwidth**: The maximum rate of data transfer across a path, or the data transfer capacity of a network measured in bits per second (bps).

2. Compare and contrast analog and digital signals, and analog and digital data:
    - **Analog Signals/Data**: Continuous signals representing physical measurements, e.g., human voice.
    
    - **Digital Signals/Data**: Discrete signals/data in binary form, e.g., data stored in computers.

3. Relationship between wavelength and frequency: Inversely proportional; as frequency increases, wavelength decreases.

4. Compare and contrast guided and unguided media with cyber security implications:
    - **Guided Media**: Uses physical pathways like cables; more secure and reliable.
    
    - **Unguided Media**: Uses wireless communication; more susceptible to eavesdropping.

5. Solve problems:
    - **Problem 2.1**: Period of the signal is 0.001 seconds.

    - **Problem 2.9**: Channel capacity calculated as 475.5 bps.

    - **Problem 2.11**: Comparison of Nyquist and Shannon theorems, focusing on noiseless vs. noisy channels.

### Chapter 3
1. **Address problem 3.7**: Packet switching is more efficient than circuit switching due to better network resource management.

### Chapter 4
1. **Answer review question 4.3, "What is a protocol?"**: A set of rules for formatting and processing data, enabling communication between different computer systems.

2. **Solve problem 4.8**: Data fragmented into 3 packets, totaling 1892 bits delivered.

### Chapter 5
1. Answer review question 5.12, "Why would you expect a CRC to detect more errors than a parity bit?": CRC provides more redundancy, making it more robust in error detection.

2. Solve problems:
    - **Problem 5.2**: Discusses antenna characteristics like beamwidth, gain, and polarization.
    - **Problem 5.4**: Difference between diffraction and scattering, focusing on wave behavior around obstacles and due to small particles.
