# Assignment 1
## WireShark

- This assignment involves using network analysis tools like WireShark, tcpdump, or tshark to capture and analyze network traffic. The main objective is to understand network traffic capture, MAC address spoofing, and file carving techniques.

### Instructions

1. **Spoof your MAC address to: `88:66:5a:43:61:74`**
    - This involves changing your device's MAC address to the specified value.

2. Capture local network traffic using any preferred tool:
    - Tools: tcpdump, tshark, or WireShark.
    - Capture all packets while browsing the web.

3. Perform an image search for "Cat" on Google:
    - Navigate to Google and search for images of cats.
    - Save one of the images to your local computer.

4. Stop capturing network traffic after saving the image.

### Submission Instructions

Create a ZIP file containing:
The packet capture file that includes only the network packets related to the file carving exercise.
The cat image you saved locally.
Any relevant encryption keys or certificates used to carve the image file.
Using WireShark, carve the cat image file from the captured network packets.
Brief Answers to the Key Concepts:
MAC Address Spoofing: Temporarily changing the MAC address to another value, often for privacy or testing purposes.
Network Traffic Capture: Recording data packets as they travel across a network. Tools like WireShark allow you to analyze these packets for various purposes.
File Carving: Extracting a specific file (in this case, the cat image) from raw network data, demonstrating how files can be reconstructed from captured traffic.
