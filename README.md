# Assignments

#### [Assignment 1 - WireShark](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS427-CyberSecurityOfWireless-DistributedSystems/tree/Assignments/Homework%201) 

- This assignment focuses on network traffic analysis using WireShark or similar tools. Students are required to spoof their MAC address, capture network traffic, and perform specific actions such as searching for an image online. The captured data must then be analyzed and manipulated, demonstrating an understanding of packet structure and network security techniques.

#### [Assignment 2 - Wireless Review](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS427-CyberSecurityOfWireless-DistributedSystems/tree/Assignments/Homework%202)

- In this assignment, students review key concepts from the course textbook "Wireless Communication Networks and Systems." The task involves defining technical terms, comparing signal types, understanding the relationship between wavelength and frequency, and solving problems related to wireless communication. This assignment aims to reinforce fundamental wireless communication concepts.


#### [Assignment 3 - WSU System](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS427-CyberSecurityOfWireless-DistributedSystems/tree/Assignments/Homework%203)

- This assignment involves analyzing the WSU (Washington State University) system, likely focusing on its security infrastructure. Students are expected to explore system-level security concepts and apply theoretical knowledge to a practical scenario. The deliverable includes a LaTeX source file and a PDF, demonstrating an understanding of complex system security.
  
#### [Assignment 4 - Passwords](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS427-CyberSecurityOfWireless-DistributedSystems/tree/Assignments/Homework%204) 

- This assignment deals with password security, likely involving tasks such as password cracking, analysis of password strength, and understanding encryption techniques. Students might be required to use provided tools and files to decrypt or analyze passwords, emphasizing the importance of secure password management in cybersecurity.

#### [Assignment 5 Skittles](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS427-CyberSecurityOfWireless-DistributedSystems/tree/Assignments/Homeworl%205)

- The Skittles assignment is a Capture the Flag (CTF) style challenge that emphasizes critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Students are tasked with attempting to decode a complex puzzle, using various cryptographic and analytical methods. The focus is on the process rather than the solution, encouraging students to document their approach and learning.
