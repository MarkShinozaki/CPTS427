# [Assignment 3 - WSU System](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS427-CyberSecurityOfWireless-DistributedSystems/blob/Assignments/Homework%203/Homework%203%20-%20WSU%20System.png)

- The assignment involves working with the WSU-System, which is a string manipulation system defined by specific transformation rules. You are tasked with transforming a starting string "WS" to an ending string "WU" using a series of given transformation rules.

### Transformation Rules:
1. Add 'U' if the string ends with 'S'.
2. Double the sequence following 'W' at the beginning of the string.
3. Replace 'SSS' with a single 'U'.
4. Remove 'UU' from the string.

### Steps Taken:
1. Start with the string "WS".
2. Apply Rule #2: "WS" becomes "WSS".
3. Apply Rule #2 again: "WSS" becomes "WSSS".
4. Apply Rule #3: Replace "SSS" in "WSSS" with "U", resulting in "WU".

### Results:
- The experiment successfully transformed the string "WS" to "WU". This process explored concepts of string manipulation and state transitions, providing insights into finite state automata.

### Discussion:
- This experiment highlights the parallels between string manipulation in WSU-Systems and maintaining secure states in complex systems, such as cybersecurity. The assignment serves as an analogy for understanding and preventing unauthorized state transitions in secure systems.
