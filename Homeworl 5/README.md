# [Assignment 5 - Skittles](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS427-CyberSecurityOfWireless-DistributedSystems/blob/Assignments/Homeworl%205/Homework%205%20-%20Skittles.png)

- The Skittles puzzle provided in the CptS 427 course is a Capture the Flag (CTF) style challenge. The puzzle consists of a file filled with Roman numerals. The goal of the assignment is not necessarily to solve the puzzle but to explore and document the problem-solving process, using various cryptographic and analytical methods to attempt a solution. This assignment emphasizes critical thinking and the application of cybersecurity principles.

### Simple and Brief Answers to the Questions

1. Introduction:

    - The Skittles puzzle involves a list of Roman numerals with no immediately discernible pattern. The assignment is to analyze and potentially decode this list using cryptographic techniques and other problem-solving strategies.

2. Methodology:

    - **Initial Analysis**: The numerals seem to follow no simple pattern. High-frequency numerals like "M" (which might act as a delimiter) could be significant.

    - **Tools Used**: The puzzle was tackled using Python code in VSCode to calculate frequency distributions, segment the data, and attempt cryptographic decoding (e.g., ASCII conversion, shift ciphers).

3. Problem Solving Process:

    - **Conversion of Data**: Conversion of Roman numerals to integers and application of frequency analysis helped identify the distribution of the numerals.

    - **Decoding Attempts**: Several methods were used, including ASCII conversion and cryptographic ciphers (Caesar, Vigen√®re), though they mostly resulted in random outputs.

4. Insights and Learning:

    - **Observations**: The high frequency of certain numerals might suggest common symbols in the encoded message, but more complex methods might be needed to decode the puzzle.

    - **Reflection**: The assignment highlighted the iterative nature of cryptographic problem-solving and the importance of methodological analysis.

### Summary
  - The Skittles assignment is a practical exercise in applying cryptographic analysis techniques. Even though a complete solution to the puzzle might not be necessary, the key takeaway is the analytical process and the understanding of complex encoding schemes in cybersecurity contexts.
